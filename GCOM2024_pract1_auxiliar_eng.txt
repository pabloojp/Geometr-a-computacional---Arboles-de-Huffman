The Lorentz transform was first inferred to satisfy the invariance of the Maxwell equations used in electromagnetism and has become the mainstay of special relativity. Shortly after Einstein published his first paper on relativity, Rudolph Minkowski recognized that the Lorentz transformation described a 4-dimensional spacetime with his metric equation. The transform implements a vector in four dimensions, three space dimensions and one time dimension. As a consequence of these transformations, a periodical phenomenon linked to a moving body appears slowed for an observer at rest.
